    <article class="post-content">
	<p>In Happy Valley, Pennsylvania, near the stately shield of Mount Nittany, stands Beaver Stadium. Holding more than a hundred thousand, its facade, looking like a metal beast, dominates the Pennsylvania lowlands.</p>	
	<p>But I’m not interested in the exterior of Beaver Stadium, nor am I interested in the interior. In fact, I’ve never stepped foot in the stadium, never heard its cheers, never heard those metal braces rumbling, never been blinded by the pure white walls of Lion faithful that gather around that sacred site every Saturday.</p>	
	<p>On one sideline there is a suite-box, a giant structure dotted with small windows, which stands guard over the end of the stadium. And on that box, in blue on white, is inscribed: “THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY.” There’s something, something unspeakably pleasant, about saying those words. I put a little bit of emphasis on the “STATE,” noting the moniker that statesmen refer to themselves using. There’s so many ways to say it, so many ways to emphasize “the,” so many ways to cap off “university,” and so many ways to pay homage to the keystone state while uttering “Pennsylvania.”</p>	
	<p>With so many abbreviations around, it’s hard to look for the unabbreviated, the long-form, the little phrases that place a little more trust into what they represent. I seldom see the University of Mississippi – he wears the robes of a collegian and that biretta, walking stately – instead, I see Ole Miss – he wears casual wear, a little more outgoing, but I would never shake hands with Ole Miss and I could never greet him by name with as much admiration as the University of Mississippi. </p>	
	<p>It’s hard to simplify strings, those words which write and form knots in my head; it’s hard to compact the information when thinking. In those dim hours of the morning when I read some article, some paper, and I see something abbreviated, I can’t muster the energy to backtrack the process, to re-route how exactly the information got into my mind. And although the moment of connection and realization when I finally remember the subject matter is a most brilliant affirmation, it’s an exhausting one, one that makes those minutes trudge on a bit slower. Everything slows down around me in fragmented pieces.</p>	
	<p>But when I do my reading and stumble across someone who writes “North Atlantic Treaty Organization,” “North Carolina,” “National Aeronautics and Space Administration,” there’s a sense of mutual understanding and respect for both the people mentioned, the author, and me; a consensus is reached that something deserves a little more dignity, a little more precision, conciseness in wording.</p>	
	<p>A lot of abbreviations end up condensing important emotions into just a word, I feel. She says “bye,” yet I can’t read the minutiae on her face, in her eyes. A word was enough for her to say but not enough for me to note, and I might think about the context, knowing that it was there but the lack of words uttered just squashed it… oh, how I long for a “farewell,” a “goodbye,” a “that is all.” Greetings are the same way too; in the search of convenience we choose to break that vessel which words are, carrying only a bare meaning and no purpose.</p>	
	<p>It might be that I just can’t see into people, just that I might lack empathy. I’ve tried time and time again to understand more given less, yet sometimes, the less that is given to me, the more there is to process. It’s a one-sided game; my opponent knows more than I ever will, yet my opponent thinks I know just the same, acting on that knowledge, just going forward, leaving me in the ruts, breathing the dust.</p>	
	<p>And perhaps one day, I’ll be able to retrace, to identify the subconscious meanings behind all of these little abbreviations, technical and emotional, but before then, I’ll keep on backtracking, grasping, with steely eyes hoping to catch another spark as the fire fades away.
