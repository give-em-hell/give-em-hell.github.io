    <article class="post-content">
	<p>I tread on the lifeless bodies of the men I could have been. Over the years, this grotesque little platform has slowly grown in height. I reap new bodies to tread on as I kill them at the crossroads, the junctions of life. They pile up, yet their faces remain still barely recognizable as they prop up the man who had killed them.</p>	
	<p>When I was younger, still more malleable, I met a few men, all named Alex, their faces weathered in slightly different ways. One was a photographer, with the heavy sling of the camera around his neck. He had become inspired to be one after a trip to Yosemite. One was an accomplished painter, having become inspired to be one after spending his time gazing off into the distance and scribbling in his notebook. One was a comedian, having become inspired to be one after a particular joke had landed well with his peers. The fourth was a mathematician.</p>	
	<p>So having become very well acquainted with these four men, I wished to keep them all around, for they were so interesting! They all had so many stories to tell of their various adventures along life’s pathway. But as my eyes gazed for the first time upon Fermat’s Last Theorem, and as I stood in awe at the way a seemingly impossibly evasive proof had finally had its validity confirmed, the mathematician beckoned to the three others, fidgeted with his revolver, and dispatched his compatriots. I took the side of the mathematician, slowly becoming him, as the years continued to roll.
</p>	
	<p>Then, in middle school, I met two more of myself. One was more athletic, and owing to the fact that he had continued swimming in high school, had become much burlier as a result. His hair was yellowed and frayed from the chlorine and the California sun. The other was more reserved, a bit quieter. Glasses lay over his nose. It was obvious that he had strained his eyes looking at music. His feet stepped rhythmically, constantly marching. But one had to die. I took the side of the academic, shuffling my feet in time, marching along.
</p>	
	<p>I have met new friends at every junction, and every time, by the time I leave the junction, all but one of them has ended up dead. When I chose to teach math, to dedicate my time to help others gain the same passions as I did, I saw a massacre at the junction; time is limited, and to push myself in one direction carries the inevitable cost of hindering myself in some other. Sometimes, I look at the men I have killed and I wonder if I should have made a different choice, if I should have chosen someone different to keep alive. I live in a sea of possible regret.
</p>	
	<p>I who stands at the junction today stands on the bodies of all those he has killed. He is singular, forged out of those who had stayed alive. He is a mathematician, analytical, striving to find something about the world he lives in. He is the shifty-eyed academic with the glasses over his nose, music coursing through his veins. Yet he is not without empathy. He stands at the junction with his head held high.
</p>	
	<p>“Do you have any regrets?”</p>	
	<p>He bows his head low, leans back, and inquires to the heavens: “What use is it to have them?”</p>	
	<p>And he stands there, pistols drawn, ready to advance.</p>
