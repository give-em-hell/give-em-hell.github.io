	<p>I learned a majority of my mathematical knowledge in Chinese.
</p>
	<p>There was a series of blue books that my dad called the <i>xiao lan shu</i> - literally “little blue book.” They were small in every dimension and were remarkably thin. Yet those books contained a long and arduous learning experience that was the result of a perfect storm of quite a few factors.
</p>
	<p>I was often told that the average Chinese middle or high school student (in China, of course) could realistically qualify for the AIME (the second tier of the American high school math competition system) without any preparation. As a Chinese kid who had not even qualified yet back then, this shook me to the core. It also didn’t help that I was about ready to start taking the AMC 10, which was the stepping stone to said exam. So when my dad bought the blue books back from China, I felt that I had something to live up to, and that I needed to show my doubters that I was indeed as good as that hypothetical average Chinese kid.
</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I was quickly humbled by just the first chapter of said book. I couldn’t bear hearing stories about hypothetical middle schoolers again, so I cheated when practicing in that book. I would look through the solutions manual and submit my “answers” for my parents to look at, and of course, they found out and stapled the section of that book shut. So back at chapter 1 I was, scratching my head.
</p>
	<p>Despite having black hair, yellow skin, black eyes, and supposedly being the descendant of dragons, my Chinese wasn’t all that good. I struggled with whether a word ended with -n or -ng (a delightful Anhui-ism, I’m sure). I had trouble differentiating my “sight words,” and words in an academic context made even less sense. I had about as much trouble actually reading the text as I did comprehending the math. It also didn’t help that some subsections were named after Chinese idioms too. Everything was a mess. It was so messy, in fact, that I had nightmares about people whom I often got compared to learning Chinese - and doing it better than me - just to read that little blue book. It was also hard to apply things that I had learned in Chinese to the English classroom. The contexts in which it was discussed were far different, and often, only very far down the line did I realize that something a teacher had told me about was a concept in Chinese that I had seen before.
</p>
	<p>This leads us to a very strange consequence: for about six years, I thought that combine harvesters were killing machines on par with tanks.
</p>
	<p>I’m not fully aware of when this misconception ended, but I am completely aware of when it started. It was formed in an instant, forged out of a Chinese children’s book about different types of vehicles. I saw the <i>shou ge ji</i> and the <i>tan ke</i> next to each other, and saw their similarly tall builds, and from that moment on, I believed that you could ride a combine harvester into battle.
</p>
	<p>But never have I ever made another conclusion on this plane of absurdity. Sure, I pronounced prologue as pro-low-goo and enough as e-noy, and the first time I saw the word deadly I read it as dee-dee-lee, but there truly was never a better example of the unique linguistics of growing up bilingual than the perceived deadliness of combine harvesters.
</p>
	<p>And the reason this misconception lasted so long? I feel that I would never have made such a misconception in English, for after I closed that book, I was never exposed to the Chinese word for combine harvester again. I heard “combine harvester” in English countless times, but never through that long stretch of time did I ever make the conclusion that a <i>shou ge ji</i> was the same item, the same concept, as the English combine harvester. These words in two languages existed in two distinct planes. And perhaps there are more concepts out there like separated twins, with one in the domain of the dragon and one in the land of liberty, whom I have not yet made to meet.
