	<p class="quot">Fight, Temple, fight on</p>
	<p class="quot">All the Temple stars will shine</p>
	<p class="quot">Skill and courage win the game</p>
	<p class="quot">Fight on, Temple, fight!</p>
	<p>Temple University, in Philadelphia, was originally named after the Baptist temple. Nowadays, it’s state-affiliated and secular. It has a pretty neat logo too, making good use of the negative space with that sculpted T with an outline not quite reaching around.</p>
	<p>Temple shares a football stadium with the Eagles – Lincoln Financial Field. It’s jarring to look at. For the other schools in the American conference, football’s a higher priority – they’ve got round stadiums, more noticeable press boxes, and bowl-esque shapes stretching around the perimeter. Temple, on the other hand, could not find space in a city that grew around it too fast. They moved into the Linc, with its geometric edges and hastily pasted “FIGHT TEMPLE FIGHT” decor on gamedays.
</p>
	<p>Even worse is the fact that despite being cherry and white, the stands are gray. That so few fans arrive at an Owls football game makes it so that the lack of fans is even more apparent and abhorrent to look upon. But invariant of the fan count is the presence of the Temple University Diamond Band, with its cherry-colored uniforms and white shakos, that brilliant sash which flashes with every turn, and the twirlers in their blazing scarlet. Prior to every game, they perform their pregame, no matter the fortune of the team; the grandstands rumble (or perhaps, for Temple, they merely sway out of sheer pity) for the band and the cheers of the scrappy handful of fans echoes around the lower bowls as the Diamond Band marches out of the tunnel.
</p>
	<p>The primary fight song of Temple is “Fight, Temple, Fight.” It’s a relic of days gone by and carries much of the sentiments too: “hold that ball and hit that line… skill and courage win the game…” It’s obviously written in a football context. But today, the average Owl fan knows only what is referred to by the university as simply a “cheer:”
</p>
	<p class="quot">T for Temple U</p>
	<p class="quot">U-niversity!</p>
	<p class="quot">FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT for the Cherry and the White</p>
	<p class="quot">For the Cherry and the White we will FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!</p>
	<p>It’s not an official fight song and it was never meant to be. The issue is that through the years, Fight, Temple, Fight has completely vanished from university records, without even so much as a mention on the Boyer school’s webpage. Normally, as time goes on, fight songs are written to be less football-specific, but since nobody is here to sing the song, nobody desires to change the lyrics.
</p>
	<p>The Diamond Band still plays Fight though. It’s played as the first line of their fanfare, and the last line of their halftime, carrying a tradition unrecognized by the fans. And what a shame, too… Fight, Temple, Fight is perhaps one of the most heart-wrenchingly lyrical melodies of any college in the United States. It is the very musical personification of hope and glory, and perhaps near-certainty in that belief that a win is always possible even when the jaws of defeat are upon you. It is even more of a pity that Temple has not bothered to do an official recording of the song for more than eighty years. Over that time, it’s been rearranged countless times, gotten slower, had its drum cadences changed, and had the piccolos removed… yet to seek a recording of it is to go back to a time when the grandstands cared, that all the Temple stars shined in unison. In those days it was played thrice through, a tradition alive and with a beating heart. And now, the closest there is to an official recording is a pre-recorded pregame show from 2020, with masks over the bells of the instruments, and with the Diamond Band split into four smaller bands, playing separately on a practice field. No man of that band stepped onto the greatest stage that season; no man with that cherry blood turned toward the cheering stands. No fans watched, no people hollered, and the grandstands stayed silent for the first time in a century as the Diamond Band played through on the videoboard.
</p>

	<p>And yet, through such an untraditional year came perhaps the clearest recording of Fight, Temple, Fight, a fight song laden so deeply with spirit and tradition, playing to nobody, yet continuing to echo around the Linc, again, again…
