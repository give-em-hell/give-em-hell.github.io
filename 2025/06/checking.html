	<p>And there I stood, unsure if my hand had moved where I willed it, if my eyes had focused where I intended to look, on the precipice of the real and the imaginary, teetering on the axis, unsure of whether to step back or push onward, yet unaware that to step back was no longer an option…</p>	
	<p>In March of 2024, I failed the Certificate of Merit piano examination. Certainly it was a significant deal for me; I had been playing piano for twelve years up until that point and to fail was to lose accreditation, validation, for all of my work.  And after the fact, it seemed like a significantly larger deal, mainly due to the fact that I attempted to grovel with my branch chairman for a pity pass.
</p>	
	<p>I had failed on a technicality which now more than ever I take responsibility for; I had not noticed some requirement in exactly which pieces had to be memorized. Battling through those late February trenches, with bloodied sore hands and bloodshot eyes, I never bothered to read the regulation that pertained to my situation. I plopped the score down on that little stand and the application had already burst into flames. And when the results came back and did indeed return a smoldering pile of – wait. Everything was rated “excellent,” except for the simple fact that I had failed. There wasn’t anything else I could have blamed it on other than just that technicality.
</p>	
	<p>I’ve never been able to live life normally again after that. Since then, I’ve never been able to send an email quickly, concisely; it’ll sit in my inbox for days and I’ll open it and read it for hours on end, unsure if it was confirmation bias that was carrying my eyes; every time before sending an email, I’d grab pieces of paper and paste them up so that I could only see a word at a time, just petrified, trembling at the thought of a word spelled incorrectly, a sentence done wrong. I’ve never been able to submit a form quickly enough. I’ve had to go through each little subset of the questions, setting the screen to maximum brightness so that what I had answered burned into my retinas; then I’d have to close my eyes and see if that little wisp, that mirage still displayed what I thought it had; it’s still not enough, I must go back and stare at it for minutes more. My own name is no solace, with the letters jumping around, offsides, grappling with each other, refusing to fit in; just eight letters. A-L-E-X-W-A-N-G. Eight letters, how much could it be? But I’ll look back at them to see if they haven’t left me, see if they haven’t changed.
</p>	
	<p>In a way, my name did leave me and it did change; Alex Wang used to be the kid who never seemed to double check, it was just an Alex thing to be doing. Stupid mistakes, laughable ones, hilarious to the bystander. In a way I’ve lost so much of what made me unique, a bit more carefree… I’ve lost that name which previously belonged to me. In searching for my name’s correctness, I’ve found that it’s no longer a correct description. Now, it looks around shiftily, checking for something, anything in its control to latch onto, to be observed one more time.
</p>	
	<p>But what, then, can I even do? In a world where nothing is certain, not even my own thoughts, what I think, what I do, what I have recorded into the annals, what can I even do? It’s hopelessly flailing, treading on slowly rising water, grasping onto anything I have control over, terrified of letting it go, it’s a vice that I cannot give up, for when I do relax my grasp, I can feel myself sinking, sinking into uncertainty, and below that, downwards to failure.
