	<p>The 747 was once the Queen of the Skies. Its massive, imposing figure, flanked by four roaring engines, and its smooth yet dominating body made me beam with pride every time that beautiful silvery bird sailed across the infinite sky. Nowadays, it has mostly been retired, a representation of the transition between the golden age of air travel and the hustle and bustle of today.
</p>
	<p>I had the privilege of meeting the 747 once, a long time ago. I saw its spiral staircase and its screenless seatbacks, with a large screen fitted on the bulkheads. It was with Air China, and I scarcely remember anything about that flight except the color grey.
</p>
	<p>It was grey all around. The walls were grey, and when I turned the overhead lights on, they were indeed a whitish yet silvery grey. The bulkhead was grey, the frame surrounding the bulkhead screen was grey. The chairs and seatbelts were grey as well. I think I slept much of the way to China.
</p>
	<p>Of course, flights are now a much more memorable ritual for me. I often note that I have been blessed with the need to fully perceive the things around me, to check out every little detail. That I have done. I go onto planes with the desire to take it all in - I run my fingers down the front seat’s pocket, note the material of the seat backing, whether the screen frame is black or grey, the color of the snack carts, the orientation of the overhead lights. I take out the safety manual and read it again and again, and then I check out every single feature presentable on that screen, but inevitably come to dwell on the map where I attempt to find cities of my choosing. There’s Ames, Iowa. There’s College Station, Texas. Columbus, Ohio. Evanston, Illinois. Starkville, Mississippi.
</p>
	<p>The night before a flight is filled with rituals too. Often, it is spent frantically downloading music to keep myself stimulated across the long day ahead. I often think that the litmus test for whether a piece of music is truly listenable is how many times I’d listen to it on a flight. If I can blast it through my ears again and again then I truly believe that I’ve found a piece of music that I love.
</p>
	<p>But back to that Air China 747. Suddenly, I wake up from a nap. Across the sea of grey, I see a glint of dark, shimmering red. “Dad, what is that?” “<i>Fan qie zhi</i> (tomato juice).”
</p>
	<p>Odd. Very odd. Tomatoes, as far as I knew back then, were vegetables. And they certainly aren’t that deep red. The tomatoes I saw before were almost glimmering on the outside. And what a strange taste, too. Very little tartness, but a light hint of what I could only recognize then as chocolate.</p>
	<p>My kindergartener mind could not muster the courage to ask the flight attendant for some of my very own <i>fan qie zhi</i>. But for some reason, the only thing that stayed with me after the flight was that sweet, sour, and chocolatey aftertaste that came in that blue plastic cup.
</p>
	<p>So it stuck. Although I never felt the urge to try tomato juice anywhere outside of 30,000 feet above ground, nor did I particularly enjoy it at all, every time the snack cart comes around a second time, I ask the flight attendant for tomato juice. I carefully note its temperature, the design on the can, and read the ingredients list. What spices might they use this time? Dehydrated onion, cilantro, or maybe dried chiles? How many calories are in that can? And how much does it crackle when I pop open the tab?
</p>
	<p>I pour out the tomato juice into my blue plastic cup (without ice). I swirl the juice around, looking at the muted tones of greys and blues around me, and the people with their eyes closed or heads buried in their laptops. The tomato juice is a break from all of that, my own personal trip to memory lane, found up here in that vast, quiet sky, set to the beat of the rumbling of the engines. And although visiting a familiar place, every time I arrive, I walk amongst a new trellis of tomatoes ripening quietly on the vine.
