	<p>For a while when I was little, I played baseball. I was absolutely terrible at it, but this sort of consistent mediocrity persisted for about six years. I was so bad at it, in fact, that I recorded one hit in my final year in this sorry little “every kid deserves to play” league. It was a bunt.
</p>	
	<p>I guess baseball was supposed to teach me the value of teamwork. Sure it did. It taught me the value of picking up sunflower seeds in the dugout and watching kids who would be moving up to travel ball next year rip the ball out of the park and then going up and ruining the inning. It taught me how to hit the plate before batting and how to hit the road without feeling too bad about my mistakes. It taught me not to worry too much about the fake smiles and congratulations when I finally caught a ball, and that cheery consolation that was almost sickly.
</p>	
	<p>What else did baseball do to me? It made me form a litany of strange conclusions within my head.
</p>	
	<p>Cincinnati is a city full of cheaters. How do I know that? We lost a game once to a team called the Reds. Crying means you care. How do I know that? My parents talked about a kid who cried after a loss for years. Buckets are good and manly to sit on. How do I know that? My coach, who I’m pretty sure only tolerated me because he wasn’t physically allowed to eject me from the team, sat on one. You can take enough complimentary pickle slices at the snack bar to reconstruct a full pickle. I guess that’s common sense. You can pick sunflower seeds off the dugout floor and eat them? The jury’s still out on that one.
</p>	
	<p>But when baseball was such a boring game to me, my eyes wandered to everything but the game. Early in the morning, the chalk lines would be laid out neatly against the first and third base lines. I’d stand close to the chalk man, noting carefully how the levers on the navy blue cart worked, and when nobody was looking, I’d press those levers and watch as the chalk chamber plugged and unplugged itself, and noted the chalk’s consistency.
</p>	
	<p>But of course, nothing intrigued me more than the pitching machine. Once I entered the pitching machine tier of the league, I instantly became very infatuated with the UPM-45 model “Blue Flame” pitching machines from Louisville Slugger. I admired that perfectly blue painted fulcrum, the rubber grips of the foot pedal, and that sleek angled look. A marvel of engineering it must have been to construct, and it turned the simple motion of launching an artificial pitch into something so regimented, so predictable. From far in the outfield I could see the triangular rubber stopper that held the ball in place, and I’d stare at it until I heard the crack of the bat, and I’d go back to looking at the rubber stopper and the springs and coils underneath it. When coach left to do something I’d go and look at the pitching machine and read the speed conversion charts tacked onto the handle and twist the knobs to a certain speed, and imagine I was doing the actions – place the ball – lock the fulcrum – press the foot lever – release – place the ball… it was truly all I cared about.
</p>	
	<p>When we moved onto those rubber wheel pitching machines, I had nothing but disdain for them. How dare they cease to let me see the coach’s mechanical motions? Where were all the speed conversion charts, that regimented ritual to make the ball fly? All I thought about was that spring-loaded pitching machine. And to this day, I still have the urge to go back in time, and read the manuals front to back, and finally fling a ball out from that beautiful blue fulcrum.
</p>	
	<p>The pitching machine, then, was more than just a metal contraption to me. It represented the abstract things that I appreciate in life - a rhythm, provided by the steps it took to fire; an enjoyable process, provided by the effort to push down the fulcrum; and finally, predictability and safeguarding, provided by those powerful springs. If baseball taught me nothing else, it would have been worthwhile – the pitching machine alone had taught me enough.
