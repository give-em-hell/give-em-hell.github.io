	<p>An intro, a first strain twice repeated, a second strain twice repeated, a trio, breakstrain, trio, breakstrain, and the trio once more. That is the structure of the American march. Dignified by nature yet regarded as out of place in situations other than extreme formality or the circus top, it is an odd music form which one renders a salute to, yet shuns everywhere else. </p>	
	<p>I do not intend to be the layman who casts a march aside as a ceremonial piece. The march form, to me, represents order and predictability in the world. Left and right, left and right, and in sixteen measures, the second theme shall be introduced. Then, a brief drum cadence. I’ve heard this music and walked this path of notes before. I know what’s going to happen, I leave nothing to chance. I reach my hand out into the cosmos and grasp tightly the threads of space-time. Everything is in my control. </p>	
	<p>I do not intend to be the layman who casts a march aside as a musical expression of one-dimensional jingoism. The march form, to me, represents utmost dedication to an item, a person, an ideal; to love something or someone so much that the swelling of your heart is set to the rhythmic beat of the drums, the pomp, the fanfare of the parade. Sousa saw the beauty in the world and felt the need to set it to music; a young lady at a fairground, the spirit of the collegian, a world exposition all stoked fire into him. I follow him in his noble passion, writing marches to document that which sets me ablaze – the facade of a theater in Fullerton, the Pyrenees in France. Every march written is a profession of love and adoration with blood pouring into the page.
</p>	
	<p>March music is tantamount to the concept of fearlessness. For too long now I have battled with the perception that the eyes of the world are on me, that there is cause for fear in every step. For too long now I have been afraid to enter the fray, an unfamiliar environment. But as did the Ottomans, the Prussians, the Spirit of ‘76, I march head held high, my steps floating on the strains of the band, the beats of the drums; through the march my vision dilates and all doubt is cast off; a spirit of infinite possibility and potential is uncorked. It is true that spirits may perhaps make a man delusional, but a certain degree of delusion is always cast upon the man who walks down the warpath with hearts rebounding, trumpets sounding.
</p>	
	<p>What, then, is the march? I am the march, so regimented, so orderly. It is almost mathematical to me, and for someone so impassioned about mathematics there is no other music that encapsulates math so clearly; the numbers all falling beautifully into place, patterns forming out of the mundane, where repetition is not seen as a flaw but instead a confirmation that natural order is still there. I am the march, so furious, so fearless. When I go out there to compete, grandiose strains remind me to go forth and conquer for everything is mine to win; it tells me not to hold back and to always try to thrust forth my flame. I am the march, so meticulous, so detailed. There are harmonies in all marches for the attentive listener to hear; there is beauty abound for attentive eyes to see, for attentive hands to feel. When I walk, I always make a note of the consistency of the gravel snares, the timbre of the windy flutes, the stateliness of the engine trumpets. I am the march, at times somber, at times cast out, but I am the march, with the final strain roaring back, more proud than anything before.
