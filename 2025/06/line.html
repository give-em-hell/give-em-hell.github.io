	<p>It’s an odd feeling, having time to spare. You roll into the parking lot much earlier than expected – perhaps you were anxious, hoping that other people would be like-minded enough. You join that meeting much earlier just to realize that professors are humans too, who’ve lived through so much more (having eaten more salt than you have rice), and have realized that having that much time to spare is simply not a sign of whatever you thought it was. So there’s not many people where you need to be, not many people who thought that one mustn’t follow the clock but instead seemingly a second for every little conductor’s gripe, every single mentor’s rant, until that morning mist has not yet cleared and you must be the one to part it.</p>
	<p>So what do you do in these twilight minutes? Even if those who you were waiting on aren’t here yet, the world certainly doesn’t revolve around you – there’s too much of a chance that there’s loads of people there already. Loads of people talking to each other, who seem to know each other, who seem to have found their places already. So you relinquish the turning of the world to them, and try to make yourself invisible, trying not to interfere with anything that might be happening. I clench my fists tight, pay attention to my steps, look down, anything to make sure that the world could still turn without me.
</p>
	<p>But I mustn’t take that time to be first in line, I mustn’t take those seconds that peers hammered into me and use them to thrust myself into first, I mustn't spearhead the pack. There are other people who need it more than me; the world shouldn’t have anything to do with me.
</p>
	<p>There might be someone else, more mature, with more fruitful minutes such that he’ll make a point of not using a single extra – go on, then, spearhead the pack; you mustn’t linger longer…
</p>
	<p>There might be someone else, more confident, with more passionate minutes such that he’ll make a point to be the first to relish whatever he was here for – go on, then, spearhead the pack; you mustn’t hold off yearning…</p>
	<p>There might be someone else, more brazen, with just a bit more bravery to stick out amongst a sea of my own; he’ll make a point to oil the gears and get the pump flowing – go on, then, spearhead the pack; you mustn’t keep us dazed…
</p>
	<p>There might be someone else, more weary, dragging his ligaments along so as not to burst apart in misery; he’ll make a point to get out of here just so he doesn’t need to be here anymore – go on, then, spearhead the pack; you mustn’t stay in anger…
</p>
	<p>But perhaps I am one of these people – hurried, ravenous, courageous, or sullen – and perhaps I have spent so much time looking that I have not noticed. But to distance yourself and let the world whirl on, just to watch what happens to these creatures of chance, to see who puts themselves first in line – that is what parts the fog on a chilly morning and wipes the dew off the pristine grass.</p>
