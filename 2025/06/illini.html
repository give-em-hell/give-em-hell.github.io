	<p>I mentioned prior that I absolutely adore college marching bands. When they take the field in their high-stepping formation, it feels like a great honor to see their seasons upon seasons of layered tradition, all wrapped up neatly in their well-trimmed uniforms and plumes waving in that electric gameday air.
</p>
	<p>In a way, these marching bands are what makes the college game different. I have a particular love for college football, a love which I can attribute solely to the bands on the field. Years ago, I saw the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band with its three-hundred and sixty members strong marching in perfect steps in the Four-Way Cross, and as I heard the announcer, with his booming voice, herald the presence of that regal, regimented bunch, I knew I was in love.</p>
	<p>Marching bands are what keeps tradition alive in the college environment. In this day and age, we’ve abandoned the chant, the fight song, the rituals. The presence of a band on or near the field in the most electric moments (see “the band is on the field,” 1982, or “Auburn’s gonna win the football game,” 2013) even if not demonstrating their form of art reminds us that tradition still exists today. I particularly enjoy “Enter Sandman” at Virginia Tech, not for the shouting fans, the fireworks, or the run-out, but because the bandsmen jump together in unison forming the tunnel for the Hokies to run through, a perfect blend between old and new.
</p>
	<p>But I rarely watch halftime shows. Every week when my favorite bands post their pregame show, I listen through it again and again, knowing everything the announcer will say (it’s a beautiful sixty-five degrees today), the intricacies of every little formation. I get to see that gameday tradition, and I get to see those grandstands fill up – walking into a cathedral of fan-fueled fervor with the band singing the praises of their Alma Mater on that field. Halftime shows hold none of that value for me. The band simply exists on the field with their glide-step marching, playing new tunes that I have no connection to – just a bunch of newfangled garbage, which, despite the playing abilities and intricacies of the band’s formations, I cannot bring myself to tap my foot along to.</p>
	<p>The Marching Illini does something different, although it’s usually not enough to warrant me watching all of their shows. They cap off every single one of their halftime shows with the 3-in-1, a collection of fight songs that not only can I sing to, I can also remember, word for word, the announcer message that comes before it:
</p>
	<p class="quot">“Developed in 1926 by the Marching Illini, there is no more celebrated tradition on any college campus than the 3-in-1, consisting of a medley of Pride of the Illini, March of the Illini, and Hail to the Orange, it has stirred the hearts of Illini fans for generations – this is the incomparable, 3-in-1!”</p>
	<p>See what I mean? Generational pride, passed down, and played through the hands and marched through the steady steps on that field. “While we’re marching along life’s pathway, may the spirit of old Illinois keep us marching and singing, in true Illini spirit, for our dear old Illinois” – this is the spirit of Urbana-Champaign, the apotheosis of the orange and the blue.
The one halftime show from the Marching Illini I did watch this year was performed on 19 October, titled “100 Years of Memorial Stadium.” Before even watching this, I knew what it would be – a celebration of everything that made Illinois great. And I would not be disappointed.</p>
	<p>On the field, anniversary logos adorned the twenty-five yard line. The thin white outline of Illinois dotted midfield. Throwback helmets and jerseys like those worn by the legendary Red Grange could be seen from Grange Grove and beyond. The stands were packed in anticipation of an Illini football team on the rise. The stadium cheered quietly as the band stepped onto the field. And then – the fanfare. The strains of “Illinois Loyalty” - “fling out that dear old flag of Orange and Blue” – then a shift to March of the Illini – “we are marching for dear old Illini” – the block I appeared before me, delivered through flawless chair-step marching – everything about this was tradition incarnate.
</p>
	<p>One of the bookmarks in my bookmarks bar is the Illini Song Book, published 1932. I often consider it to be my favorite PDF file, a homage to how many times I’ve come back to it to find a new treasure of Illini history among those yellowed pages - be that the forgotten Alma Mater of “For Good Old Illinois,” or “Cheer Illini.” One song that initially was not much of an attraction to me was “Fight, Illini” – I had hummed the tune and sang the lyrics to myself while following through the sheet music many times, but I could never find a recording of it. But then, after the announcer finished, the band broke into what I instantly recognized as the song revived after a century of negligence – Fight, Illini filled the air of Champaign for the first time in a long, long while. On the back of the cover of the songbook, it was written “They play ‘em, we sing ‘em” – in that moment, I did exactly as told. I followed along: “fight and hear our cheering for you IL-LI-NOIS, fight and fear no foe, we’re for you, IL-LI-NOIS!”
</p>
	<p>Then, Goldman’s “Illinois” broke through the afternoon sky, and the band formed into block formation, marching in unison, not in abstraction or letters, but in military style. And when the band sang the trio - “we sing our praise to thee, Illinois, Illinois, Illinois…” I watched, beaming, almost in tears at the simple beauty of this tribute. And as always, the halftime show ended with the legendary 3-in-1, and I clapped and sang along once more, divided by thousands of miles but united by this heritage, this tradition, this music.
</p>
	<p>I truly do love “100 Years of Memorial Stadium.” They played and I sang, and from thousands of miles out, they moved my heart. Victory… Illinois… Var-si-ty!</p>
