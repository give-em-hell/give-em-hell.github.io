    <article class="post-content">
	<p>I think a lot of things have changed in the past few years of my life, but it may really just be that the way I see the world around me has shifted. Classical music has lost its taste for me; what once was the highest form of art to me has shed all of its hue, and the pages of Mozart and Beethoven and such have become drenched in so much sweat and tears that the notes have become unintelligible and the ink has bled out of the page. I used to want to be taller, and now I no longer have a desire to be taller not because I actually grew but because I stopped seeing it as such a need. A lot of things within me have changed.
</p>
	<p>There is, however, one particular thing that I still have not been able to determine if there are genuinely less of them now or if my perception of them has changed. That would be the dark, billowing clouds, receding, retreating after a rainstorm, as the sun beamed down on their faces.</p>
	<p>I love the rain, and even more than that, I love being out in the rain. Often I thought of it as a drink for my motherland of Southern California, as it swept away the dirt and enriched the lawns and fields and the planters around the school. I loved the way it sounded; it was a distraction from the constant music in my head, and let me lay myself to rest with true quiet in my mind. It was like a distinguished guest; it moved through the streets on gilded roads of rushing water, through the creek as it swelled triumphantly once more; I gazed out as it walked along, gracing the city with its presence. When the rain left, I could still see its stately silhouette taking the form of those dark sunlit clouds, a boundary set in the heavens between this beautiful rain and the monotony of the blazing sun; I hated those sunlit clouds for what they signified – the death of the rain.
</p>
	<p>I was more perceptive when I first noticed and began to resent these clouds. The sunlit clouds needed certain conditions to exist; the rain had to end on an afternoon as the sun beat across the driveway. I would only be outside during the afternoon for sports practices or other team-based activities, and I hated the thought of talking to other people and having to thrust myself into a populated environment. Whenever I did see these clouds, the dread of my destination compounded with inability to relinquish the rain, and ever after, those clouds became seemingly unnatural, hostile, a symbol of something that didn’t belong.
</p>
	<p>Those clouds, then, sought to destroy everything in their path. Whatever music was playing in the car as those clouds loomed ahead formed quick and gruesome associations that were burned into my mind; any music played during those instances became unbearable after the fact. A swim practice with those clouds slowly drifting away became instantly tainted with a touch of somberness, as I had to hope that the rain would return, that those clouds would disappear. Swaths of freeway now feel cold and damp as the car rumbles across them, swaths that stood on pathways that the clouds marched through.
</p>
	<p>These memories still linger, but peculiarly, as I reflect on recent years, those clouds have appeared in my life no more. When I remember the clouds the feeling of dread grips me once again, but it has been years since I last saw rain clouds retreating tiredly through the sky. Perhaps it is not the rain clouds but instead I who has vanished; it may be that rain still parades itself proudly through the city but I no longer have the time to put my work down and see its royal brigade. Perhaps I no longer have time to perk my head up during the afternoon, perhaps the retreating rain is not enough to wrestle me out of my chair.</p>
	<p>The rain will return and go once more, as it always has; the fact that I no longer salute its presence has no bearing on its actions. But maybe, just maybe, those retreating clouds have become less somber, less hostile, and I am writing an elegy for that dying rain draped in gray, the dying rain whom I mourned.</p>
