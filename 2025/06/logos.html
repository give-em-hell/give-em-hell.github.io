	<p>Personally, I’m not a fan of licensed clothes, jerseys, or name brand jackets. I wear a plain black polo shirt and plain black pants. Aside from the obvious fact that you’re just paying for a logo, I feel like it puts too much of myself out there for my liking.
</p>
	<p>“Alex, that cannot be true,” you remark. “You have worn your unit jacket for the past three years every day without fail.” That might be true. But what information did you get out of me that wasn’t there already? I feel like you need significant amounts of confidence to put so much information out there.
</p>
	<p>How useful is information to me, then? That is a rather vague question; it must be answered in context. So let that context be made. Suppose you are walking in an airport hall, a busy, poorly-designed airport with people coursing through its arteries and veins. Suppose you are walking in a rather uninteresting section of a museum, perhaps a bit about cars when you would rather be absorbed in the section about trains. Perhaps you are walking through busy streets with somewhere to be, but that little area right in front of your eyes is not interesting enough.
</p>
	<p>So you glance off to the side, and look for something to get you out of this bog. And you might find rather interesting ads on the wall, but more often than not, the environment around you is mostly just people, and you have to make do with that.
</p>
	<p>Certainly, some people are braver than I am. They are more willing to put themselves out there and tell the world a bit more about themselves without even speaking. They keep the “rep” (good words, VT) for their organization’s sake. And I guess that in some sick sense, these people that are willing to share just a bit more become little bits of entertainment in those numbing times.
</p>
	<p>Much of the time, it’s a college shirt, a college cap, maybe a jersey. It’s touching and endearing to me; these men with graying hair and thick glasses, every day, thinking back to the years they spent at their alma mater, where their hearts yearn once more for the cobbled paths and those grand halls.
</p>
	<p>In Las Vegas, there’s a man proudly wearing an Oregon Ducks sweatshirt. It’s got the vintage logo, the linked U-O; something tells me that he’s a fan of rigid traditions. As he walks past, I hum “Oregon, our alma mater, we will guard thee on and on;” he remains unaware of all the little things that I just saw in him. Perhaps he has places to be; that flight to Eugene may have been his. 
</p>
	<p>In Washington D. C, a man walks with his wife through the smoldering air, wearing a BYU Cougars cap. Perhaps they are indeed Latter-Day Saints. I wonder how many times they’ve been outside of Utah. Where were they when LaVell Edwards led the Cougars to the only mid-major national championship in the history of college football? Did they cheer for the Alamo Bowl and weep at that Kansas loss? The cougar on that cap circles the old blocky letters of the “bYu” logo; did they have that cap since their bright college years? I’ll never know, of course, but as I walk by after that fleeting glance, I do wonder if they ever do rise and shout on the road to fame and glory.
</p>
	<p>Perhaps it is hypocrisy for me, so terrified of the gaze of others, to wonder so intensely about strangers. Perhaps I am the reason the adages exist, perhaps I am the reason that people learn to distance themselves in public. But for that brief, fleeting moment, these men and women so proud of their story paint the world in dazzling colors, and my eyes are drawn to these little demonstrations of honor that twinkle like the Pleiades.
