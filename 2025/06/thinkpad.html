	<p>You could have convinced me that this thing was built to kill. </p>
	<p>After working at FileNet for a while, during which he moved to California, my dad ended up working for the company that absorbed FileNet – IBM. During the early 2000s, IBM aggressively marketed their ThinkPad line of products, which were named after that boxy-lettered slogan found all over t-shirts, notepads, and pens: “THINK.” IBM sought to create a line of products with unparalleled durability and utility, and out of that was born the hillbilly of the laptops, the ThinkPad.</p>
	<p>I had a Lenovo ThinkPad W530, which was the pinnacle of engineering, if you lived in 2012. They never had a good battery life. They didn’t need to have one. If you took that brick somewhere, you best believe you were plugging it in. They never were sleek and ergonomic. They didn’t need to be. It was meant to fend itself off from scratches, dents, and falls, and survive anywhere from the Valley of Kings to the ISS. And when I took that laptop to competitions, my backpack was always four pounds heavier than everyone else’s.
</p>
	<p>There’s a certain intangible beauty in still using an old ThinkPad. Newer models are far more expensive and have lost some of their old design philosophy, whether that be due to a true shift in thinking or just the flow of innovation and time. Keeping that brick on one’s desk is a reminder of caring only about painfully bare utility. Bonus points if Windows 7 is used.
</p>
	<p>The old ThinkPads came with HDDs which made a soft whirring noise every time they were started up. It was slow and nasty. I had a particular love for Kerbal Space Program, the game with the little green men, and every time I wanted to play it, it was an entire ritual. The screen would freeze a couple of times, and it was so concerning seeing the HDD groan and seize that I found it a little more dignified to look away. But eventually that game would start, the main menu screen would strike up the band, and I could play that game at a decently tolerable performance, slinging my kerbals wherever they needed to be. Then it’d get late and I’d have to watch the computer flop around for many more minutes until I finally put it to sleep. 
</p>
	<p>By the time that laptop hit the 7-year mark, I had taken a serious interest in composing. I downloaded MuseScore 4 and fiddled around with the keys. But I inevitably fell in love with the power of the concert band, and with all of those instruments loaded in, I’d have to take out my headphones lest the full second of input delay completely ruin my sense of hearing.
</p>
	<p>Otherwise, though, it was fine. It could run everything that I needed it to run decently well. And maybe that was the biggest problem with it. The ThinkPad, so mighty and imposing, was like a king on a mission to rule until its last breath. Neither I nor my parents could really bear to buy a new laptop for me while it was still alive. It had things that were amazing in 2012 that were still amazing in 2025 - a decent RAM, good storage, and unparalleled durability. But I guess by that point the only logical conclusion was to force it to abdicate.
</p>
	<p>By then, it had fallen off of my desk numerous times, been banged around in my backpack many more, and had burn marks and superglue marks, a sunken trackpad button, and multiple dysfunctional keys. But the sad thing is, even with all of these wounds, it still barely marches on at 100% disk capacity. When we took it out of retirement for an emergency, it could still perform every task my dad needed for work with utmost speed. And I still get the question of why we decided to retire the ThinkPad if it still worked that well.
</p>
	<p>The ThinkPad W530 today, then, straddles the line between functionality and obsolescence. It remains barely good enough for today, with the design school of thought from two decades ago. It exists in a world where it should fit in, but not quite. It is too good to retire but too undignified to watch. The Lenovo ThinkPad W530 is in the worst of both worlds.
