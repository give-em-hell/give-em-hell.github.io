	<p>What an odd word to behold.</p>	
	<p>Command of language is something that I have a lot of trouble with, at least when giving presentations or just speaking in general. It was very odd to a number of my peers that even when no script was demanded for a certain presentation, I still wrote the script and read it aloud again and again, knowing that spoken words were permanent but virtual ink on pixels was temporary. I would cozy up inside the backspace button, circle around it, and gaze upon what seemed like the panacea to my verbal qualms.</p>	
	<p>Evidently, I can’t do this when standing in front of others, so I have a small quick-fix for that. If I want to converse with someone for a while, I try to lead them into a set conversation that I’ve written out in my head tens and hundreds of times. I’ll ask questions I already know the answers to. I’ll string together topics to get back into my verbal elysium. I have a remarkable affinity for forcing a one-on-one conversation to go a certain way.
</p>	
	<p>Part of this was forged out of some sort of social anxiety. I need to do things in a very set and defined order, otherwise control leaps out of my hands and I am thrust into an unfamiliar and hostile world. I listen to the same music at the same time every day. Walking across the quad to physics last year, I would listen to the “Cavalier Song” à la University of Virginia, musing about how “once more our might has won the fight,” knowing that the fight was simply just to stay in control of my environment.
</p>	
	<p>One of these aforementioned verbal safe spaces is the topic of anxiety. It’s something I’m pretty familiar with, so if I want to talk to someone, it’s a good place to get them to stay. But then, I get asked the following: “how do you have anxiety if you’re talking to me just fine?” In a way, this demonstrates that what I’ve been doing has worked - do you realize why we’re still talking in the first place? I’m not anxious in this space in my mind.
</p>	
	<p>So, born out of this desire for command of language, out of my pencil sprung a litany of literary cliches. “Demonstrates that…” “shows an intense dichotomy between…” “it is worth noting that…” But the most ubiquitous of these was the word “utilizes.”
</p>	
	<p>I was in a hurry and time was winding down on that essay. I was frantically searching my suitcase for something, just a word I could wear so that I could act formal, act dignified. That’s when I met Utilizes. It was beautiful, just sublime. More dignified than “use,” and just the right complexity.</p>	
	<p>Of course, wherever I went, Utilizes came along. When I was meeting professors for the first time, it was by my side. And of course, we loved going on dates in the place we first met – when the time was winding down on an in-class essay.</p>	
	<p>Unfortunately, being in this relationship had its toll. I had begun to - and pardon me for bringing it here too - overutilize Utilizes. It was sad to see the panacea I had leaned on for so long become a crutch. I still loved Utilizes - a brilliant word - but my peers did not. “Why do you use it so much? You don’t sound like a human.” My US History teacher certainly believed that this word made me something inhuman, a machine built to spew out formalities in the most meager of situations.</p>	
	<p>But alas, I cannot give up this love. It represents everything that I admire - control over my own language, the formality that I adore - yet to be seen with Utilizes is to make me less than myself, a contraption of unfeeling steel, tapping at the keys to please someone else. With so much formality, yet no dignity at all – “Utilizes” is in the worst of both worlds.</p>
