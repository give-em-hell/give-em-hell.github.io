	<p class="quot">Solomon! Solomon! Solomon! Solomon! Solomon!</p>
	<p class="quot">I love you Solomon this one proud well-built man</p>
	<p class="quot">Yet I cannot feel your beautiful face or glance upon its visage</p>
	<p class="quot">It is obscured, I look beyond, for something perhaps to see you for you</p>

	<p class="quot">Ay Solomon rid me of this zhuk these flaming cinders and coals</p>
	<p class="quot">Which so brand me and burn at my sides</p>
	<p class="quot">Speak to me but refrain from biting, freezing</p>
	<p class="quot">Speak to me for I am three a gloomy person.</p>
	
	<p class="quot">Ay Solomon you see it all, you may weigh your words with mastery</p>
	<p class="quot">Look into me a point behind intently so that you may have no distinct limit</p>
	<p class="quot">Year after year I await the day where you will gaze behind me once more</p>
	<p class="quot">And six six I will realize you have never forgotten me.</p>
	
	<p class="quot">I love you Solomon and I wish I must never cover your face</p>
	<p class="quot">With this thick canvas or shroud that I must burn all down</p>
	<p class="quot">I will you to arrive to appear in front of me I know I must never realize never be enlightened</p>
	<p class="quot">For I love you Solomon for in the eyes of others you are just S yet to me you are indelible.</p>
