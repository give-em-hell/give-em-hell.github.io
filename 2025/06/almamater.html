	<p class="quot">Hail Alma Mater</p>
	<p class="quot">Where you with your divine providence and outstretched arms</p>
	<p class="quot">and full of that grand spirit of neutrality and liberty</p>
	<p class="quot">from the Cuyahoga Side to the Mekong</p>
	<p class="quot">put something firm enthroned in every heart.</p>

	<p class="quot">Hail Alma Mater</p>
	<p class="quot">Where you stood on cloud nine and went back to a normal life</p>
	<p class="quot">ignorant that you are and still are and still will be deplorable</p>
	<p class="quot">stood over nineteen nineteen twenty twenty nineteen/p>
	<p class="quot">and decided that justice had prevailed.</p>
	
	<p class="quot">Hail Alma Mater</p>
	<p class="quot">Where you saw the coming generations thronging to seek her side</p>
	<p class="quot">where on that holy day of dynasty-felling you came and sought exceptionalism</p>
	<p class="quot">and presided over the throne flanked by peace and fury</p>
	<p class="quot">and dedicated but thirteen seconds to their pleas.</p>
	
	<p class="quot">Hail Alma Mater</p>
	<p class="quot">Where we rallied round the vaunted halls and the columns of the Merrill</p>
	<p class="quot">and we dared to struggle and dared to win and killed our parents and smoked in</p>
	<p class="quot">and napalmed the dog and carried its burning body round</p>
	<p class="quot">during break as the flames went forward.</p>
	
	<p class="quot">Hail Alma Mater</p>
	<p class="quot">Where we may blacken the skies once more with stones and invite tragedy</p>
	<p class="quot">and we bums all of us will look through all that is clumsy and condescending</p>
	<p class="quot">and we will gather around you Alma Mater mother of heroes</p>
	<p class="quot">and Hail to Thee Alma Mater.</p>
