    <article class="post-content">
	<p>I take the bus from Irvine to Troy during the school year. I sit in the aisle seat, usually finding a place next to someone I know. The window seat is too unpredictable, too harsh.
</p>
	<p>But sitting in the window seat doesn’t ensure that there’s a lack of window. Early in the morning when the coat of grogginess has not quite been shed, the heads are down. Or for those who never put on the coat in the first place, the heads are down for a different reason. Either way, the windows are strikingly clear and in the open. 
</p>
	<p>I often try to get myself to do some work or be productive on the bus. I have never been able to do that. Sitting on the bus is an inherently uncomfortable experience, and having a device out makes it just that much worse. I cram the music into my ears, trying to keep everything else out of it. It feels like I can hear the way people hear me, and see the way people see me even though my head is turned. There are not many places I go to that are more terrifying than the bus. So I look outside, to the slowly waking buildings around, the foliage on the side of the roads, the City of Santa Ana water tower, the guitar store, the murals, the telephone lines, and the variety of hues around me. 
</p>
	<p>I feel that the facades of buildings can strike the strongest of emotions within me with just a cursory glance. In middle school, I went to the University of Texas at Austin, and just so happened to be around their stadium. Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium – a cathedral of sports in the American southwest. Walking around the stadium, I saw those red-orange bricks, those stately towers standing high upon the Austin horizon. I was in the presence of pure, unadulterated might. And although I knew nothing about the game of football, and was almost completely unaware that I was even standing in front of a stadium, those long shadows and towering walls had told me enough.
</p>
	<p>On the bus path to Troy there’s two buildings that particularly catch my eye, and they just so happen to be right next to each other on opposite sides of the freeway.
</p>
	<p>Angel Stadium tells a long story. You can see it through its seating capacity. By 1980, it was, by today’s standards, an exceptionally large MLB stadium, due mainly to the fact that it played home to the Los Angeles Rams. It had what I consider a beautiful function - dual-configuration. Nowadays, dual configuration is scarce. Teams feel the need to separate from their counterparts in other sports, and born out of that were brand new stadiums like SoFi, and out of this wave of change came the dead body of the Oakland Coliseum and the salt-stained corpse of Aloha Stadium in Hawai’i. The Rams left, of course, and the stadium was shrunk down to what it is today - a 45,000 seat stadium, plastered with advertisements in the back, huge floodlights, and the California Spectacular. </p>
	<p>But I’m not in Angel Stadium. As the bus rumbles by, I only get to see a glimpse of its outer facade. I see the bare concrete concourse, the ramps leading up to the stands. And I see within it something sad, something forgotten. Those bare concourses create within me images of Three Rivers Stadium or the old Shea, their ramps laid to rest as they crumble into the dust, being swept away by the steady march of time. I see that plain tan color and can only think of a cathedral that sacrificed all of its charm, its potential, for some new, modernistic ideal.
</p>
	<p>There’s also the Honda Center, now slowly being covered up by a parking structure. But seeing it makes my heart swell up with pride. That same tan color radiates some sort of glory off into the cool morning air, and the semicircular glass windows reflect some of that beautiful orange glow. But by far the highlight of its exterior is the roof, unafraid to show its sense of utility, the beams meant to fend it off from the whims of the ground below it incorporated perfectly within its design. The symmetry and its pure white color resembles a shield, flat on the ground, like the Roman testudo standing in formation, unfazed by whatever nature may hurl toward it. With the same colors, the same materials, the Center has converted weakness into strength, converted unabashed modernity into refined strength and power.
</p>
	<p>So there I sit, nestled between rise and ruin, force and feebleness. One side of the freeway cowers from the rising sun, and the other glimmers with radiant hope from its rays. All these feelings from a glance of mere seconds – yet to merely glance upon another living soul, the shallowest of understandings, takes days, months, years.
