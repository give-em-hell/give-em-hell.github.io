    <article class="post-content">
      <p>On a rather still and long-shadowed weekend morning (I forget exactly which day), I was in the skylit room of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands visitors center. In one of the small black trashcans in the corner of the room, there was, sitting among a pile of virtually nothing (as is commonplace in mornings), a perfectly intact snakeskin. I had gone to my fair share of parks in the past and had seen rangers talk about a litany of molting reptiles. So interesting it was to me, in fact, that for as long as I can remember, I have been searching for the molted skins of little critters in the dust and chaparral on the sides of the trail, much to the chagrin of those around me. It was astonishing then, to see an item so intriguing cast away in the junk heap. I wanted to take it home and hang it up like a trophy.</p>
      <p>I am Chinese. I am American as well. I can’t call myself a Chinese-American, or American-born Chinese, because that at least somewhat implies that I have been able to reconcile these two parts of my identity or let one dominate the other. I have often told myself that red blood courses through my veins, but I have also told myself that I pledge allegiance – to the flag – of the United States of America – and to the republic… it is not very often that I force myself to reckon with this conflict. </p>
      <p>As a sidenote, I was born in the United States. In California. Growing up, my parents had often told me that “the eyes of the world are upon you.” Perhaps this was hyperbole, but it was also very true considering how openly and brazenly judgmental many of the adults around me were. They were quick to deliver criticism and I was quick to receive it. Another part of this Chinese upbringing was the need to respect one’s elders. With both of those statements combined, I understood it as follows: I would need to make sure the eyes of the world were not on me in order for me not to offend others, and in order to not offend my elders, I should not bother them unless absolutely necessary. This worked out better than expected. As a side effect of this, I said “sorry” a lot, called people “sir” or “ma’am,” and learned incredibly formal language in order to frame my emails to elders. “You should see the way he writes emails,” said my history teacher from seventh grade. “Thank you, sir,” I respond.</p>
	<p>So that is the “Wang” in Alex Wang. Where, then, is the “Alex?” You won’t find “Alex” where you find “Wang.” “Alex” was told often that he was allowed to make mistakes, that he need not be judged instantaneously, vigorously, and visibly. So in front of lifelong friends, in front of supportive teachers, “Alex” appears, eager to engage in discussion. The problem arises when “Alex” has the eyes of the world placed upon him. He overexercises his expression. He overstays his welcome. He is too much of himself in front of the people with daggers for eyes.</p>
	<p>This usually happens when people tell stories of “Alex” to those who know me as “Wang.” My elementary school camp counselors, who thought it would be interesting to note the many jokes I told one day at camp. My friends, who talked about “Alex” to their parents, delivered the bad news to my own. What happens then? What do I choose to be in front of people? I find it much safer and easier to be “Wang,” unoffensive, unoriginal.</p>
	<p>So now we return to the snakeskin in the trashcan. “Alex” wants the snakeskin. “Alex” would go and ask if he could take the snakeskin which he cherishes so much. “Wang” thinks of the park ranger and realizes that by asking, he exposes himself to judgment. In this harrowing moment I must deal with both of these identities fighting for control.</p>
	<p>People often say that being multicultural is the best of both worlds. For me, that is not true. When I must reconcile with both these identities, I am in the worst of both worlds.</p>
