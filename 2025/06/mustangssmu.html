	<p>As of 2025, both of these teams have found themselves thrust into the Atlantic Coast Conference. Which is fine, I guess, simply by the merit of Texas having a sliver of coastline bordering the Atlantic. It’s far less egregious than some of the other schools here.</p>
	<p>I listen a lot to college marching bands. I think it is because I have been missing a lot of that pomp and tradition in my life. I might write a chant for a team I’m on. I might give them pre-competition speeches. “What the hell are you doing?” is often the response. When I talk about the values of tradition, some of my friends bury their heads in shame. In a way, listening to these college fight songs is therapeutic. In the examples provided above, these songs tell me to keep on fighting, and remind me that tradition is not something useless that gets made fun of at any turn. And when I’m not listening, very often, I hum these tunes or play them again and again in my head.
</p>
	<p>Located in the heart of Dallas, SMU has a football program forged in history and tradition. It was founded in 1915, and rose to national prominence in the early 40s, and by the 1980s, within the old SWC, found itself being national title contenders year after year. Unfortunately, SMU also paid their players hefty sums through a slush fund; in 1987, the program was given the death penalty, and they proceeded to not win a postseason game for the next quarter of a century. Fortunately, their luck has turned around.
</p>
	<p>SMU’s marching band is one of the smallest in the Power Five. Despite its logo consisting of the diamond-shaped “sMu,” the band only contains enough members to form the “M.” The Diamond M, whether it be on the green during gameday or planted in rye grass at Hell’s Half Acre, remains a symbol of pride for University Park. Remarkably, through these thin ranks and files there arises a deep and beautiful sound – the sound of “Mustang Jazz,” which is a blend with such vigor and fire yet such nuanced classicism that it is a shame I cannot enjoy it at all.</p>
	<p>Why? Virginia. As a colonial college, it would be very obvious to see that they too have history and tradition. A while back, along with their uniform, the then-Virginia Pep Band also carried within the folds of their jackets the crass humor that comes with many of the colonial colleges including their Ivy League brethren up north - irreverent sex jokes, hazing, and no marching pattern whatsoever. By 2011, the school administration had heard enough of this, and replaced the Virginia Pep Band and its painted sousaphone bells with a band more fitting for their fight song.
</p>
	<p>Now, on Saturdays, at Scott, the Cavalier Marching Band, in their regal hues of blue and orange, march in front of those beautiful white columns, on the green turf that they call home. Their fight song is “The Cavalier Song,” which, save for its archaic lyrics, carries similarly deep countermelodies and both rigid militarism and school-spirit fervor. But “Pony Battle Cry” has its first two lines sound so incredibly similar to “The Cavalier Song” that when the headphones aren’t in, this is what I hear:
</p>
	<p class="quot">Here’s to the red and the blue</p>
	<p class="quot">We’re the Mustangs from S-M-U</p>
	<p class="quot">And all men raise their voice to praise</p>
	<p class="quot">The orange and the blue</p>
	<p>Despite being blessed with a beautiful melody and that rich southern swagger, SMU’s fight song, in front of me, at least, can enjoy none of those. “Pony Battle Cry” is in the worst of both worlds.
